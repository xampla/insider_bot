## 📖 Trading Concepts Glossary

### SEC & Regulatory Terms

**SEC Form 4**: A document that company insiders must file with the Securities and Exchange Commission (SEC) within two business days after executing a transaction in company securities. Contains details about the insider's identity, position, transaction type, number of shares, and price.

**Insider Trading**: Legal transactions where company officers, directors, and employees buy or sell their own company's stock. Must be reported to SEC via Form 4 filings. (Note: This is different from illegal insider trading involving non-public information).

**SEC EDGAR**: Electronic Data Gathering, Analysis, and Retrieval system - the SEC's database where all public company filings are stored and made publicly available.

### Technical Analysis Terms

**ATR (Average True Range)**: A volatility indicator measuring the average trading range over a specific period (we use 14 days). Higher ATR means more volatile price movement. Used for position sizing and stop-loss placement.

**Volume Filter**: A requirement that stocks meet minimum trading volume thresholds to ensure adequate liquidity for entering and exiting positions without significant price impact.

**SPY Gap**: The difference between SPY (S&P 500 ETF) opening price and previous day's closing price. Large gaps (>0.5%) often indicate market volatility, so trading is paused on these days for risk management.

**Position Sizing**: Determining how many shares to buy based on portfolio size, risk tolerance, and the stock's volatility (ATR). Larger positions for less volatile stocks, smaller positions for more volatile stocks.

### Strategy & Risk Management

**Momentum Trading**: A strategy that buys stocks showing strong upward price movement, based on the theory that trends tend to continue in the short term.

**Stop Loss**: An automatic order to sell a stock when it falls to a predetermined price, limiting potential losses. We use ATR-based stop losses (typically 0.5x ATR below entry price).

**Paper Trading**: Simulated trading using virtual money to test strategies without financial risk. All trades are recorded but no real money is involved.

**Dry Run Mode**: System operates normally (monitors, analyzes, generates signals) but doesn't execute actual trades. Used for testing and validation.

**Backtest**: Testing a trading strategy using historical data to see how it would have performed in the past. Helps validate strategy effectiveness before live trading.

### Insider-Specific Terms

**Direct vs Indirect Ownership**:
- **Direct**: Shares owned personally by the insider
- **Indirect**: Shares owned through trusts, family members, or other entities controlled by the insider

**Transaction Codes**:
- **P**: Purchase (buying shares)
- **S**: Sale (selling shares)
- **M**: Exercise of options/warrants
- **F**: Payment of exercise price or tax obligation by surrendering shares
- **G**: Gift of shares

**C-Suite Executives**:
- **CEO**: Chief Executive Officer (highest ranking executive)
- **CFO**: Chief Financial Officer (manages company finances)
- **COO**: Chief Operating Officer (oversees daily operations)
- **CTO**: Chief Technology Officer (leads technology strategy)

### Risk Management Concepts

**Earnings Season**: The period when public companies report their quarterly financial results. Typically occurs in the weeks following quarter end (January, April, July, October). Stock prices can be more volatile during these periods.

**Multi-Insider Bonus**: Additional scoring points when multiple company insiders buy shares on the same day, suggesting strong internal confidence in the company's prospects.

**Confidence Levels**:
- **HIGH**: Score 8-10 points, strongest signals with multiple positive factors
- **MEDIUM**: Score 6-7 points, good signals but fewer confirming factors
- **LOW**: Score <6 points, weak signals that don't meet trading criteria

### Portfolio Management

**Portfolio Value**: Total value of all holdings in the trading account (cash + stock positions + other investments).

**Max Daily Trades**: Risk management limit on the maximum number of new positions that can be opened in a single trading day.

**Position Value**: Dollar amount invested in a single stock position (shares × price per share).

1. **Trigger**: Buy at market open following insider Form 4 purchase filings
2. **Volume Filter**: Target $30M-$100M daily volume (earnings) or $30M-$10B (year-round)
3. **Volatility Filter**: Require ATR ≥3.5% (earnings) or 7-20% (year-round)
4. **Market Filter**: Skip trades when SPY gaps >±0.5%
5. **Insider Quality**: CFO/COO > CEO > Directors, Indirect > Direct ownership
6. **Multi-Insider Events**: ≥2 insiders same day = high conviction signal
7. **Risk Management**: ATR-based stop losses and take profits
